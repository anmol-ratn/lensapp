# lensapp
### Web App that mimics Google Lens

Visit http://lensapp.live to see it in action.

To host the app locally, you need to have docker running on your machine
Then run the commands below:
```
git clone https://github.com/anmol-ratn/lensapp.git        # Clones this repo
cd lensapp
docker compose up                                          # Launches the app
```

By default app runs on port 80, to change that modify `docker-compose.yml` file.
